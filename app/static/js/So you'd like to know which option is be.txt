So you'd like to know which option is better to set up a Subscription. Either using Stripe Elements ( https://stripe.com/payments/elements ) to collect the customer's Payment method details and then set up their Subscription or collecting their details through SetupIntents ( https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents ) and then setting up their Subscription. Is that correct?
